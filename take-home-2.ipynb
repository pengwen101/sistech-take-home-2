         "The course focuses on the problem of supervised learning within the framework of Statistical Learning Theory. It starts with a review of classical statistical techniques, including Regularization Theory in RKHS for multivariate function approximation from sparse data. Next, VC theory is discussed in detail and used to justify classification and regression techniques such as Regularization Networks and Support Vector Machines. Selected topics such as boosting, feature selection and multiclass classification will complete the theory part of the course. During the course we will examine applications of several learning techniques in areas such as computer vision, computer graphics, database search and time-series analysis and prediction. We will briefly discuss implications of learning theories for how the brain may learn from experience, focusing on the neurobiology of object recognition. We plan to emphasize hands-on applications and exercises, paralleling the rapidly increasing practical uses of the techniques described in the subject.",

         "In this course, you will learn the basics of computational neuroscience via hands-on model building in Neuroblox and Julia. You will simulate models from the literature, from single neurons to large circuits with synaptic plasticity, and fit them to neural data. By the end of the course, you will be able to model your data, build your own custom circuit “blox” that may be incorporated into the Neuroblox library, and explore how interventions such as drugs and stimulation probes affect neural circuits.\n\nComputational neuroscience aims to simulate the brain *in silico*, from single synapses to brain-wide networks. The field has matured in tandem with experimental neuroscience, to the point where computational modeling has become an indispensable tool for understanding neuroscience data and motivating future experiments. However, building such models can involve a painstaking process of translating concepts from the literature into working code, then optimizing it to run in a reasonable timeframe.\n\nNeuroblox is a new software platform for computational neuroscience that aims to break down these barriers. It is based on the Julia programming language, built with simplicity, modularity, and performance in mind. It consists of a library of modular computational building blocks (“blox”) that can be easily assembled to simulate brain dynamics in code or via an easy-to-use graphical interface. Our tools bridge scales from spiking neurons to brain waves and fMRI, and have applications to neurology and psychiatry. Moreover, the behavior of multiple model variants can be compared to discriminate between competing hypotheses.\n\nTo learn more about computational neuroscience and the team's research, visit the [Laboratory for Computational Neurodiagnostics website](https://www.lcneuro.org/).\n\n**Course Audience:** Anyone interested in exploring how the brain works, including how it leads to cognition. \n\n**Course Prerequisites:** Prior coding experience is beneficial but not necessary.\n\n**Course Structure:** Brief presentation of background material, followed by hands-on exercises and open-ended challenges.",

That has stimulated fervent discussion among educators about the implications of generative AI systems for curricula and teaching methods across a broad range of subjects. It has also raised questions of how to understand both these systems and the at times overstated claims made for them. This class will introduce the foundations of generative AI technology, and participants will explore new opportunities it enables for K–12 education. It will also describe and explore how an analytical frame of mind can help make clear the core issues underlying both the successes and failures of these systems. Much of the work will be project-based, involving implementing innovative teaching and learning tools and testing these with K–12 students and teachers.",

Selected topics such as boosting, feature selection and multiclass classification will complete the theory part of the course. During the course we will examine applications of several learning techniques in areas such as computer vision, computer graphics, database search and time-series analysis and prediction.

         "In this course, you will learn the basics of computational neuroscience via hands-on model building in Neuroblox and Julia. You will simulate models from the literature, from single neurons to large circuits with synaptic plasticity, and fit them to neural data. By the end of the course, you will be able to model your data, build your own custom circuit “blox” that may be incorporated into the Neuroblox library, and explore how interventions such as drugs and stimulation probes affect neural circuits.\n\nComputational neuroscience aims to simulate the brain *in silico*, from single synapses to brain-wide networks. The field has matured in tandem with experimental neuroscience, to the point where computational modeling has become an indispensable tool for understanding neuroscience data and motivating future experiments. However, building such models can involve a painstaking process of translating concepts from the literature into working code, then optimizing it to run in a reasonable timeframe.\n\nNeuroblox is a new software platform for computational neuroscience that aims to break down these barriers. It is based on the Julia programming language, built with simplicity, modularity, and performance in mind. It consists of a library of modular computational building blocks (“blox”) that can be easily assembled to simulate brain dynamics in code or via an easy-to-use graphical interface. Our tools bridge scales from spiking neurons to brain waves and fMRI, and have applications to neurology and psychiatry. Moreover, the behavior of multiple model variants can be compared to discriminate between competing hypotheses.\n\nTo learn more about computational neuroscience and the team's research, visit the [Laboratory for Computational Neurodiagnostics website](https://www.lcneuro.org/).\n\n**Course Audience:** Anyone interested in exploring how the brain works, including how it leads to cognition. \n\n**Course Prerequisites:** Prior coding experience is beneficial but not necessary.\n\n**Course Structure:** Brief presentation of background material, followed by hands-on exercises and open-ended challenges.",

That has stimulated fervent discussion among educators about the implications of generative AI systems for curricula and teaching methods across a broad range of subjects. It has also raised questions of how to understand both these systems and the at times overstated claims made for them. This class will introduce the foundations of generative AI technology, and participants will explore new opportunities it enables for K–12 education. It will also describe and explore how an analytical frame of mind can help make clear the core issues underlying both the successes and failures of these systems.
